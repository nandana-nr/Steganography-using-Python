Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography

Overview
This project focuses on enhancing secure communication by integrating steganography and encryption techniques. The system first encrypts a secret message and then hides it within an image, ensuring confidentiality and undetectability. This dual-layer approach protects sensitive information from unauthorized access and interception.

Features
âœ… Dual-Layer Security â€“ Encrypts and conceals messages for enhanced protection.
âœ… Steganography-Based Data Hiding â€“ Embeds encrypted text into images without noticeable changes.
âœ… Python-Based Implementation â€“ Efficient and easy-to-use solution using powerful libraries.
âœ… High Imperceptibility â€“ Hidden messages are undetectable by the human eye.

Technologies Used :
Programming Language: Python
Libraries :
OpenCV â€“ Image processing
NumPy â€“ Data manipulation
Pillow â€“ Image handling

End Users
Government Agencies â€“ Secure transmission of classified information.
Journalists & Whistleblowers â€“ Concealed communication in restrictive environments.
Cybersecurity Experts â€“ Protection of sensitive data against cyber threats.
Researchers & Academicians â€“ Study and enhancement of steganography techniques.

Conclusion
This project successfully integrates encryption and steganography to create a highly secure data-hiding system within images. The combination of cryptographic protection and hidden transmission ensures confidentiality, integrity, and stealth in communication.
